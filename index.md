# Instructions for use

### Navigate to [https://forestry.io](https://forestry.io)

You will need to log in as the mld-pre-sales user. 
This user's details can be found in 1Password (if you don't have access chat woth your nearest friendly pre-sales).

### Open up the Demo Site

* Click the Pages link in the side bar.
* Click 'Create New' on the editor pane.
* Click 'Folder'

### Name the Folder after the company you are Demoing to i.e. mcdonalds
Please keep the folder name as one word or a hyphenated word all lower case. i.e. kentucky-fried-chicken

### Click on the Newly Created Folder

## Creating a Page
You can now create branded pages for demoing to your client.

There are currently 3 pages available
1. landing-page
1. email
1. unsubscribe

### Landing Page 
This page is for use with Salesforce flows and represents an example home page for a client. 
This has a link to the Salesforce Communities function via the 'My Account' link in the nav bar.

### Email
This page will generate an html email that can be copied and pasted into outlook as an example for the client. 
The email will have consentric links automatically configured to access the unsubscribe page. If this page has not been created, these links will not work.

### Unsubscribe
This page provides a page that a user can be directed to after clicking an unsubscribe link. This will have an embedded widget configured. The unsubscribe and manage links in the email above will direct a customer to this page or this page can be used in isolation.

## Managing a Page's Content

Clicking on your newly created page will take you through to a form that can be filled out to manage the content of that page.

Most of these fields are self explanatory just covering text for various sections of the page, 
however there are a few that MUST be filled in correctly in order to ensure the demo runs as expected.

#### Layout
The Layout field tells the demo how to draw your page. There are currently three valid entries for this:
* ```landing-page```
* ```email```
* ```unsubscribe```

These must be entered as above to make sure the site renders correctly.

### Folder
The Folder field is used to tell the Demo where to look for content.
This must be entered with a '/' in front of it and should be what you called your folder above.
Be warned this field is Case Sensitive and again the site will not render correctly if not specified correctly.
