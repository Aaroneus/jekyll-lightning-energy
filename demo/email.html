greeting: Hello there
first-paragraph: You recently called us to book a smart meter installation. You should now have received confirmation of your appointment, and be all set for our engineer’s visit.&nbsp;During the call we also asked if you’d be interested in taking part in a trial, which you kindly agreed to do.&nbsp;
second-paragraph: We’re delighted to inform you that you’ll be using our Smart Energy App with your smart meter(s), rather than a Smart Energy Tracker handheld device. We’re really excited about the App, and think it will transform the way our customers engage with their energy. We hope that the trial will prove this.
